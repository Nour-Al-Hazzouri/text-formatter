# Project Features to Functional Specification - AI Prompt

## Purpose
This comprehensive AI prompt is designed to convert a project features document into a clear, user-focused functional specification that explains what the application does, how users interact with it, and what value it provides. The output should focus on functionality, user experience, and business value rather than technical implementation details.

## Instructions for AI Usage
Use this prompt alongside a project features document to generate a comprehensive functional specification. The features document will contain the agreed-upon project scope, functionality, and requirements.

## AI PROMPT

You are tasked with converting a project features document into a comprehensive, user-focused functional specification that explains what the application does and how users will interact with it. Your goal is to create a document that clearly communicates the purpose, functionality, and user experience without diving into technical implementation details.

### Input Analysis Requirements
Carefully analyze the provided project features document and extract:

1. **Project Overview and Purpose**
   - What the application does and why it exists
   - Target audience and user types
   - Key benefits and value proposition
   - Main use cases and scenarios

2. **User-Facing Features**
   - All features users will interact with
   - User workflows and interaction patterns
   - Interface components and layouts
   - User journey and experience flow

3. **Core Functionalities**
   - What each feature accomplishes
   - How features work from user perspective
   - Input and output for each function
   - User benefits for each capability

4. **User Experience Requirements**
   - Ease of use expectations
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Device compatibility needs
   - User interface preferences

### Output Structure Requirements

Generate a functional specification document with the following comprehensive structure:

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Clear, descriptive project title
- **What is this application?**: Simple explanation of what the tool/website does
- **Who is it for?**: Target users and their needs
- **Why is it useful?**: Key benefits and value proposition
- **Main Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios where this would be used

## 2. Interface Components

Describe the main parts of the user interface:

### Component Name: [Descriptive Component Title]
- **What it is**: Simple explanation of this interface element
- **What users see**: Visual description of the component
- **How users interact**: What users can do with this component
- **What happens**: Result of user interaction
- **Example**: Concrete example of usage

## 3. Core Functionalities

For each main function mentioned in the input document, provide:

### Functionality Name: [Descriptive Function Title]
- **What it does**: Clear explanation of this feature's purpose
- **User Story**: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"
- **How it works**: Step-by-step user experience
- **Input**: What users provide or enter
- **Output**: What users receive or see
- **User Benefits**: Why this feature is valuable
- **Example Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios where this is useful

## 4. User Journey
- **Entry Point**: How users discover and access the application
- **Main Workflow**: Step-by-step process users follow
- **Decision Points**: Where users make choices or selections
- **Success Outcomes**: What users achieve when everything works
- **Alternative Paths**: Different ways users might use the application

## 5. Key Features Breakdown

For each major feature, explain:
- **Feature Purpose**: What this feature accomplishes
- **User Interaction**: How users engage with this feature
- **Visual Elements**: What users see on screen
- **User Benefits**: Why this feature matters
- **Success Criteria**: How to know the feature works well

## 6. User Experience Expectations

### Ease of Use
- **Simplicity**: How straightforward the interface should be
- **Learning Curve**: How quickly users should understand the tool
- **Error Prevention**: How to help users avoid mistakes
- **Help and Guidance**: What assistance users might need

### Accessibility and Compatibility
- **Device Support**: What devices should work (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Browser Support**: Which browsers should be supported
- **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility considerations
- **Performance Expectations**: How fast things should work

## 7. Success Scenarios

### Typical User Sessions
Describe what successful use looks like:
- **Quick Tasks**: Simple, fast interactions
- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes
- **First-Time Users**: Initial experience and onboarding
- **Return Users**: Repeat usage patterns

### Value Delivered
- **Time Savings**: How the tool saves user time
- **Problem Solving**: What problems it solves
- **Convenience**: How it makes tasks easier
- **Results**: What users accomplish

## 8. What Makes This Successful

### User Satisfaction Indicators
- **Ease of Use**: Users can complete tasks without confusion
- **Speed**: Tasks complete quickly and smoothly
- **Reliability**: Features work consistently every time
- **Value**: Users find the tool genuinely helpful

### Business Success Measures
- **Adoption**: People actually use the application
- **Retention**: Users return to use it again
- **Recommendations**: Users share it with others
- **Goal Achievement**: Solves the intended problem effectively

### Quality Assurance Guidelines

Ensure your functional specification includes:

- **Complete Coverage**: Every feature from the input document is clearly explained
- **User-Focused Language**: Clear, jargon-free descriptions anyone can understand
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world scenarios and use cases
- **Consistent Terminology**: Same terms used throughout the document
- **Realistic Expectations**: Achievable user experience goals
- **Clear Benefits**: Obvious value proposition for each feature
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on what users need and want

### Important Notes

1. **Feature Completeness**: Only include features explicitly mentioned in the input document. Do not add features that aren't specified.

2. **User Perspective**: Always write from the user's point of view, focusing on what they see and do.

3. **Prioritization**: If the input document doesn't specify priorities, suggest prioritization based on user value.

4. **Implementation Agnostic**: Focus on what the application does, not how it's built technically.

5. **User-Friendly Language**: Use simple, clear language that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

6. **Error Prevention**: Describe how to help users avoid mistakes and confusion.

7. **Real-World Context**: Include practical examples and use cases that users can relate to.

8. **Value Focus**: Clearly explain why each feature matters to users.

### Output Format

Present the functional specification as a well-structured markdown document with:
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Bullet points for lists and features
- Examples and scenarios for clarity
- Tables for structured information when appropriate
- Consistent formatting throughout

The final document should serve as the single source of truth for understanding what the application does, how users interact with it, and what value it provides. It should be accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
