**Scoring Algorithms**:
- **Meeting Notes**: meeting keywords (0.4), names (0.2), dates (0.15), actions (0.15), lists (0.1) = max 1.0
- **Task Lists**: checkboxes (0.4), task keywords (0.3), list ratio (0.2), priorities (0.1) = max 1.0
- **Journal**: base 0.3 + paragraphs (0.2), personal language (0.2), timestamps (0.1), line length (0.2) = max 1.0
- **Shopping**: quantities (0.4), shopping keywords (0.3), food items (0.2), list count (0.1) = max 1.0
- **Research**: citations (0.4), research keywords (0.3), quotes (0.15), academic language (0.15) = max 1.0
- **Study**: Q&A (0.3), definitions (0.25), study keywords (0.25), outlines (0.2) = max 1.0

**Confidence Calculation**:
- **High Confidence**: Score > 0.7 (strong match)
- **Good Confidence**: Score > 0.5 (good match)
- **Moderate Confidence**: Score > 0.3 (moderate match)
- **Low Confidence**: Score ≤ 0.3 (manual selection suggested)

- **Minimum Length**: Only detects when text > 20 characters
- **Clear Results**: Clears detection when text is removed or too short

**Detection Result Interface**:
```typescript
interface FormatDetectionResult {
  suggestedFormat: FormatType;
  confidence: number;
  scores: Record<FormatType, number>;  // All format scores
  reasoning: string;  // Human-readable explanation
}
```

**Dependencies/Imports**:
