# Text Formatter/Organizer - Website Concept

## Overview

A browser-based text formatting and organization tool that transforms messy, plain text notes into well-structured, readable formats using intelligent pattern recognition. The application operates entirely client-side without requiring APIs or backend services.

## Core Concept

Users paste unorganized text into the application, which then automatically suggests the most appropriate formatting style or allows manual selection from available formats. The transformation happens in real-time with a side-by-side comparison view.

## Key Features

### Dual-Pane Interface
- **Input Pane**: Original, unformatted text area
- **Output Pane**: Formatted result with live preview
- **Side-by-side comparison** for immediate visual feedback
- **Copy/export functionality** for formatted text

### Intelligent Format Detection
The system analyzes input text using pattern recognition to suggest optimal formatting:

#### Content Analysis
- **List Recognition**: Identifies bullet points, numbered items, dashes, and sequential patterns
- **Header Detection**: ALL CAPS text, lines ending with colons, or standalone short phrases
- **Action Items**: Keywords like "TODO", "CALL", "FOLLOW UP", "REMINDER"
- **Meeting Notes**: Patterns like names, dates, decisions, action items
- **Quote Recognition**: Text in quotation marks or conversation patterns
- **Code/URLs**: Technical content, links, file paths
- **Date/Time Patterns**: Various date and time formats for standardization

#### Smart Structure Detection
- **Indentation Logic**: Detects spacing patterns for nested content
- **Grouping Similar Lines**: Sequential related items become lists
- **Context Awareness**: Line relationships and hierarchical structure
- **Length-Based Formatting**: Short lines after long ones often indicate sub-points
